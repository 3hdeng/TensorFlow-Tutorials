tf.Variable
tf.placeholder

http://learningtensorflow.com/lesson4/
So far we have used Variables to manage our data, 
but there is a more basic structure, the placeholder. 
A placeholder is simply a variable that we will assign data to at a later date.


tf.Variable(tf.random_normal((5,10), stddev=0.01))

x = tf.placeholder("float", 3)
X = tf.placeholder("float", [None, 784])

 if we defined a much larger graph of operations, we can run just a small segment of the graph. 
 This subgraph evaluation is actually a bit selling point of TensorFlow, 
 
Placeholders do not need to be statically sized. 
Letâ€™s update our program to allow x to take on any length. Change the definition of x to be:
x = tf.placeholder("float", None) 

x = tf.placeholder("float", [None, 3])
The first dimension of the placeholder is None,
meaning we can have any number of rows. 
The second dimension is fixed at 3, 
meaning each row needs to have three columns of data.



tf.slice(input_, begin, size, name=None)

Extracts a slice from a tensor.

This operation extracts a slice of size size from a tensor input 
starting at the location specified by "begin". 
The slice size is represented as a tensor shape, 
where size[i] is the number of elements of the 'i'th dimension of input 

begin is zero-based; 
 If size[i] is -1, all remaining elements in dimension i are included in the slice.

I had this exact problem recently and used

$ apt-get install python-numpy
This adds numpy to your system python interpreter.

Can you edit your question to include the output of:

apt-cache policy python2.7-dev
apt-cache policy python2.7
and maybe:

apt-cache show python2.7


 $ apt-cache policy python2.7-dev
