tf.split(split_dim, num_split, value, name='split')

Splits a tensor into num_split tensors along one dimension.


For example:

# 'value' is a tensor with shape [5, 30]
# Split 'value' into 3 tensors along dimension 1
split0, split1, split2 = tf.split(1, 3, value)
tf.shape(split0) ==> [5, 10]
Note: If you are splitting along an axis by the length of that axis, consider using unpack, e.g.

num_items = t.get_shape()[axis].value
[tf.squeeze(s, [axis]) for s in tf.split(axis, num_items, t)]
can be rewritten as

tf.unpack(t, axis=axis)
Args:

split_dim: A 0-D int32 Tensor. The dimension along which to split. Must be in the range [0, rank(value)).
num_split: A Python integer. The number of ways to split.
value: The Tensor to split.
name: A name for the operation (optional).
Returns:

num_split Tensor objects resulting from splitting value.
