 For unicode strings StringIO can be used like a file opened in text mode, and 
 for bytes a BytesIO can be used like a file opened in a binary mode.
 
 
 

Buffered I/O streams provide a higher-level interface to an I/O device than raw I/O does.

class io.BytesIO([initial_bytes])
A stream implementation using an in-memory bytes buffer. It inherits BufferedIOBase.

The optional argument initial_bytes is a bytes object that contains initial data.

BytesIO provides or overrides these methods in addition to those from BufferedIOBase and IOBase:

getvalue()
Return bytes containing the entire contents of the buffer.

read1()
In BytesIO, this is the same as read().
