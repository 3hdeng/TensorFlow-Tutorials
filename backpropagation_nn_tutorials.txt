RNN are typically used as part of Machine Translation systems. Secondly, a language model allows us to generate new text (I think that’s the much cooler application).
Training a language model on Shakespeare allows us to generate Shakespeare-like text. 

Another way to think about RNNs is that they have a “memory” which captures information about what has been calculated so far.

unrolling we simply mean that we write out the network for the complete sequence. F
or example, if the sequence we care about is a sentence of 5 words, 
the network would be unrolled into a 5-layer neural network, one layer for each word
