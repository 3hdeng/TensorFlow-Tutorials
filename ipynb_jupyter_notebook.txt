start notebook with --script flag will save .py file alongside .ipynb on every save

On the command line, you can use nbconvert:

$ ipython nbconvert --to script [YOUR_NOTEBOOK].ipynb

 In principle it's just two lines of code, plus i/o:

from IPython.nbformat import v3, v4

with open("input-file.py") as fpin:
    text = fpin.read()

nbook = v3.reads_py(text)
nbook = v4.upgrade(nbook)  # Upgrade v3 to v4

jsonform = v4.writes(nbook) + "\n"
with open("output-file.ipynb", "w") as fpout:
    fpout.write(jsonform)
But not so fast! In fact, the notebook API has a nasty bug: If the last cell in the input is a markdown cell, v3.reads_py() will lose it. The simplest work-around is to tack on a bogus <markdown> cell at the end: The bug will delete it, and everyone is happy. So do the following before you pass text to v3.reads_py():

text += """
# <markdowncell>

# If you can read this, reads_py() is no longer broken! 
"""
