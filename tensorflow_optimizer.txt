tensorflow optimizer

http://learningtensorflow.com/lesson7/

import tensorflow as tf


x = tf.Variable(0, name='x')

model = tf.initialize_all_variables()

with tf.Session() as session:
    session.run(model)
    for i in range(5):
        x = x + 1
        print(session.run(x))
        


We can alter this workflow to instead use a variable as the convergence loop, 
such as in the following:

import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(0., name='x')
threshold = tf.constant(5.)

model = tf.initialize_all_variables()

with tf.Session() as session:
    session.run(model)
    while session.run(tf.less(x, threshold)):
        x = x + 1
        x_value = session.run(x)
        print(x_value)

The major change here is that the loop is now a while loop, 
continuing to loop while the test (using tf.less for a less-than-test) is true.
